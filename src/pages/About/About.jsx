          <div><p>I am a passionate and self-taught MERN stack developer with a drive for learning and adapting. As the first graduate in my family, I have taken every educational step independently, learning from the experiences of others. Coming from a Hindi-medium background, transitioning to an English-based B.Tech program was a challenge, but I graduated without any backlogs. After a brief period of preparing for government exams, I realized my true passion lies in web development. Over the past year, Iâ€™ve honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, MySQL, Express.js, Node.js, React, and more, all through self-study via YouTube. I am eager to bring my problem-solving abilities and determination to the professional world.</p></div>
